## Introduction

<!-- I was reading Tidy Text Mining by David Robinson and Julia Silge where they walk us through text mining Jane Austen's work. I wanted to test out the same idea for analyzing our texting patterns. How do we chat? Is it possible to tease out trends from our pinging habits? -->

We all have intuitions, questions or even hypotheses if you will about people's texting patterns. Tom uses a lot of emojis, Daisy is a cynic and Harry swears a lot. But unless we can substantiate our theories with data our guesses will remain speculations however educated. 

I had a few questions. What are people's most used words? Are people positive or negative in general when they speak? How do people use emojis? Do people 

The place where I have the most chats is Whatsapp. So I decided to take one group chat from whatsapp for analysis. Obviously, blogging about chats with other people is tricky, because... it involves chats with other people. Apart from getting the said group's members' consent, I anonymized their names and I have taken utmost care not to publish the chats themselves as far as possible (Apart from a preview of the first 10 ones).


## Processing

If you are interested only in the results, please ignore the code blocks wherever you see. Also, skip this section and head over to the [analysis](#analysis) section right away.

If any of you want to repeat it for your personal chats, this is the method I followed:

1. Go to the chat window that you want to analyze on whatsapp.
2. Go to options and there will be an option to export the chat as email.
3. Send it to your email and download the chat text file

I am using whatsapp from an Android phone and I followed the above steps to get the chat text file. Naturally, I searched for preexisting R packages to parse the text file. There were a few packages but they were outdated and incompatible with the current format of the export file. So I wrote my own parser. 

### Patterns

I am basically constructing pattern matchers using regular expressions but I am using an excellent package called rebus that generates the regex patterns using human readable functions. I am pretty sure the patterns I have generated won't cover all the possibilities and so might not work for you but with a little tweaking, it can easily be made to.    

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, rebus, lubridate, tidytext, magrittr,
               sentimentr, magrittr, plotly, rtweet, ggthemes)

df_emojis <- rtweet::emojis

pattern_emojis <- df_emojis %>% pull(code) %>%  literal() %>% or1()

pattern_new_message <- 
  NEWLINE %R% one_or_more(DGT) %R% "/" %R% one_or_more(DGT) %R% "/" %R% 
  one_or_more(DGT) %R% "," %R%
  SPACE %R% one_or_more(DGT) %R% ":" %R% one_or_more(DGT) %R% 
  rebus::or(" AM", " PM") %R% " - "

pattern_phone <- 
  literal("+") %R% 
  one_or_more(DGT) %R% 
  SPACE %R%
  one_or_more(DGT) %R%
  SPACE %R%
  one_or_more(DGT)

pattern_name <- 
  one_or_more(ALPHA) %R%
  zero_or_more(SPACE) %R%
  zero_or_more(ALPHA) %R%
  zero_or_more(SPACE) %R%
  zero_or_more(ALPHA)
```

### Parsing
After generating the patterns, I executed the below code block to parse the file. (Actually, I ran this and a few more commands to anonymize people.)
```{r}
# input file
txt_chat <- read_file("~/projects/sandbox/data/xxx.txt")

txt_split <- 
  txt_chat %>% 
  str_split(pattern_new_message) %>% 
  pluck(1)

txt_split <- txt_split[2:length(txt_split)]

txt_new_message_pattern <- 
  txt_chat %>% 
  str_extract_all(pattern_new_message) %>% 
  pluck(1)


df_chats <- 
  tibble(chat_time = txt_new_message_pattern,
         chat_text = txt_split) %>%
  mutate(sender = 
           chat_text %>% 
           str_extract(rebus::or(pattern_phone, pattern_name)),
         text = 
           chat_text %>% 
           str_replace(literal(sender), "") %>% 
           str_replace(zero_or_more(literal(":")), "") %>% 
           str_replace(SPACE, "") %>% 
           str_trim(),
         time = mdy_hm(chat_time), 
         emoji = str_extract(text, one_or_more(pattern_emojis)),
         emoji_count = str_count(text, pattern_emojis),
         media = text %>% str_detect(literal("<Media omitted>")),
         text = ifelse(media, "", text)
         ) %>%
  add_count(sender) %>%
  filter(!(sender %>% str_detect(DGT)),
         !(sender %>% str_detect(or1(c("created", "added", "left", "changed"))))) %>%
  mutate(id_chat = row_number()) %>% 
  select(id_chat, time, sender, text, media,  emoji, emoji_count)

```

```{r include=FALSE}
df_chats <- read_rds("~/projects/sandbox/data/xxx_anon.rds")
var_ignore_words <- c("sathya","la", "ஒரு", "nan", "irku", "semma","lam",
                      "919962670603", "youtu.be","oru", "enna","naga",
                      "ah",
                      "madhiri","padam","idha","da", "guru", "https",
                      "rem", "iruku", "aiyo", "dhan", "என்று",
                      "thaan", "என்ன","பணம்")
```


Let's see how the table looks. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
df_chats %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  make_table()
```
Awesome. Now that we have data in a tidy format, let's delve into the analysis. 


## Analysis

### Pet words

#### Overall word usage

What words do the group members use a lot overall? 

```{r}
df_words <- 
  df_chats %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words, "word") %>% 
  filter(!word %in% var_ignore_words) 

df_words %>% 
  count(word, sort = T) %>% 
  top_n(15, n) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_inorder(word) %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

The members seem to agree. A lot. 

If you're wondering how words like "and" and "the" are not the most common, kudos. Those words are indeed  the most common but I have removed such words (commonly called "stop words" in text mining) because they are not informative. 

#### Word usage by member

And what words do each of the members use? Let's look at the five most used words.

```{r}
df_words %>% 
  count(sender, word, sort = T) %>% 
  group_by(sender) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n), .by_group = T) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(word = word %>% fct_inorder() %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sender)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_light() +
  facet_grid(sender ~ ., scales="free") +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  scale_fill_tableau()
```

#### Word usage made better

Well, most of the words are commonly used ones. Very predictable and not very informative. How do we find words that are important relative to each member? Enter tf-idf! Tf-idf is a concept used in information retrieval where in the importance of each term is measured relative to the prevalence of that term. Basically, if you are using a term a lot and that term is used a lot in general, the count does not accurately reflect who you are. It's the words that you use a lot but others don't that say more about you. That's a very crude explanation but the Wikipedia article is pretty good and simple if you want to dig deeper.


```{r}
df_words %>% 
  count(sender, word) %>% 
  filter(n > 15) %>% 
  bind_tf_idf(word, sender, n) %>% 
  group_by(sender) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(word = word %>% fct_inorder() %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = sender)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_light() +
  facet_grid(sender ~ ., scales="free") +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  scale_fill_tableau()

```

I feel very foggy personalities seem to emerge (A - playful?, B - philosophical?, C - jejune?). Can actually look at more words but don't want to give too much away. 😜

### ⌚ 4⃣ 😂😋😍

In case you are wondering what the heading means, it's "Time for emojis". I promise I'll try not to do that again. Anyway, can we repeat the same analysis that we did with words for emojis?

#### Popular emojis and chronic roflitis

Most used emojis in group:
```{r}
df_emoji_split <- 
  df_chats %>% 
  group_by(sender) %>% 
  summarise(emoji = emoji %>% ifelse(is.na(.), "", .) %>% paste0(collapse = ""),
            emoji_count = sum(emoji_count, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(emoji_split = 
           map(emoji, function(emo){
             emo <- emo %>% str_split("", simplify = T) %>% .[1,]
             tibble(emoji = emo) %>% 
             left_join(df_emojis, by = c("emoji" = "code"))
           })) %>% 
  select(sender, emoji_split) %>% 
  unnest()

df_emoji_split %>% 
  add_count(emoji, sort = T) %>% 
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 10) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(emoji = fct_inorder(emoji) %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(emoji, fill = sender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  scale_fill_tableau()
```

My personal hypothesis was right - A has a serious case of roflitis. 

#### Let's put a smiley on that face

Using the same concept of tf-idf we can now find out which emojis characterize people better than raw counts.
```{r}
df_emoji_split %>% 
  count(sender, emoji,description, sort = T) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(emoji, sender, n = n) %>% 
  group_by(sender) %>% 
  filter(tf_idf == max(tf_idf)) %>% 
  arrange(sender) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(sender = sender %>% fct_inorder() ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sender, y = 10, label = emoji)) +
  geom_text(size = 30) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 40),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) 
```

#### Emoji to word ratio

```{r}
df_chats %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  group_by(id_chat, sender) %>% 
  summarise(word_count = n()) %>% 
  left_join(
    df_chats %>% 
    # filter(!is.na(emoji)) %>% 
    select(id_chat, time, emoji_count),
    by = "id_chat"
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(week = week(time)) %>% 
  group_by(sender, week) %>% 
  summarise(emoji_count_sum = sum(emoji_count),
            word_count_sum = sum(word_count),
            emoji_to_word = emoji_count_sum/word_count_sum) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, emoji_to_word, col = sender)) +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  scale_color_tableau() +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot could mean one of two things:

- Something genuinely funny or sad or emotional was being discussed in weeks 19 and 28. 
- A classic case of conformity? If one person uses a lot of emojis, other members tend to too. This seems more likely as there 3 lines follow the same trend from start to finish. 

Also is A's emoji usage an indication of realization of roflitis as was pointed out in the group? I may never know. 

### Getting sentient about sentiments

Finally let's take a look at the chats from a sentiment perspective. Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing a given corpus of text and then using some method to analyze sentiment scores. Naively, a score is assigned to a word and the scores of all words in a sentence are added. But a sentence like *"The movie was not good at all"* would still be positively evaluated by such a technique. So I am using a package called `sentimentr` which accounts for valence shifters (like 'not') and intensifiers (like 'very'). For example,
```
tibble(
  text = c("The movie was horrible",
            "The movie was not good at all",
            "The movie was okay",
            "The movie was good",
            "The movie was very impressive")) %>% 
   mutate(num = row_number(),
          review = get_sentences(text)) %$% 
   sentiment_by(review, list(num, text)) %>%
   sentimentr::highlight()
```

<img src="/analyses/2018-10-03_whatsapp_analysis_files/sentiment.png" alt="sentiment_example" style="width:75%;"/>

Now that we know what we can do, let's calculate the sentiment scores for the chats. 
```{r}
df_sentiment <- 
  df_chats %>% 
  unnest_tokens(sentence, text, token = "sentences") %>%
  mutate(sentence_sent = get_sentences(sentence),
         id_sentence = row_number())


df_sentiment <- 
  df_sentiment %$%
  sentiment_by(sentence_sent, list(id_sentence, sender)) %>% 
  left_join(df_sentiment, "id_sentence") %>% 
  as_tibble()

```

```{r}

```


## Conclusion

Admittedly, one group-chat tells only a small part of the story. If there were a way to get all whatsapp chats in a single step, we could do much richer analyses. For instance, chat behavior of the same person in different groups would be interesting to see. Similarly, it could be seen how the proportion of texts sent to each group or person varies across time. That could shed light into which bonds are becoming stronger and which ones are becoming more weaker. Sentiment analysis on all our texts can help us understand how our moods vary. So many possibilities...  

Any comments, feedback or suggestions are, as people say, 😍😍😍.
