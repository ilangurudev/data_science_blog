<h1>“Series Intro”….</h1>
<p>I started getting into a python seriously about a year ago. I tried learning the language a couple of times before that - I watched a lot of introductory tutorials in the hope of getting good at it. There was one really good one - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU">Corey Schafer’s Python tutorials</a> on YouTube. Barring that, most of the tutorials were basic and went over the same things over and over again - variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc. I found it hard to get past that plateau. A year of coding in python and now, I am comfortable with the language. I still don’t consider myself an expert and <em>want to go beyond the basics or “level up” if you will</em>.</p>

<h1>Level up posts</h1>
<p>As I learn new concepts, I wanted to document them here for my own reference later and for people who are also looking to level up. I plan to update this post with new content I write. Some concepts I plan on writing about (as I learn): Generators, Decorators, Context Managers, Iterators &amp; Itertools, Logging, Exception Handling, Best Practices, Multiple Inheritance &amp; Minxins, Metaclasses, ABC classes, Callbacks.</p>
