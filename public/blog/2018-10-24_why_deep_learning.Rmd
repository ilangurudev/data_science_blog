# Introduction (A brief note about the fastai mini-series)

I am beginning the 2018 iteration of the popular fastai course, [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/). Having been a passive listener to the previous iteration of the course, I know many of the key concepts in theory. However I plan to be a lot more involved with the practical aspects of the course this time. I plan to write short, accessible lessons based on my understanding of the material as I progress through the course. I am sure there will be excellent notes of the lessons themselves by other amazing people who also take the course with me, as well as posts that are technically rigorous. The motivation of these posts however is to explain the key concepts in very simple and brief terms. The idea is for anyone to be able to understand deep learning terminology (and also for me to understand the intuition of the concepts). I plan on linking my own posts and build on them as the lessons get more complex.

# Why deep learning

Without further ado, let me start. Why would you choose deep learning? Why not other machine learning algorithms?
