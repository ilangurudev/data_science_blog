      <description>Why I am writing this. Why git? And what is github? Myths Github is just Google Drive for code You need to be able to code to use these things  Advantages Project snapshots Pay it forward Project management A project page or wiki. Collaboration A portfolio of your research Branching, merging and pull requests Command line? No problem!  Some guidelines   Why I am writing this. Having been in the masters program in industrial engineering and computer science while doing research, I have witnessed a great deal of disconnect between the tools computer scientists use and how researchers in others fields operate.</description>

      <description>Setting Up Motivation Workflow General Instructions 1. Aggregate the data 2. Cluster the data 3. Extract the patterns 4. Formatted output  Using tidyverse to fully exploit approxmapR   ApproxmapR is an R package for the approxmap algorithm, used for exploratory data analysis of sequential data. When we have longitudinal data and we want to find out the underlying patterns, we use approxmap. approxmapR aims to provide a consistent and tidy api for using the algorithm in R.</description>

      <description>Thoughts on R and Machine Learning… I started coding in R in 2015. I was pretty new to coding and especially, data science. I had heard of packages like ggplot2 and dplyr but I assumed they were packages that you learned once you learned the basics of R. ggplot2 seemed tough with words like geoms and aes and dplyr with the dangerous looking %&amp;gt;%. For a year and half, I never made an effort to learn new tools no matter how much I strugglled with base R (and to be honest, never really learnt that properly either).</description>

      <title>The Statistically Significant Four</title>

      <description>Why the big 4 deserve all the praise they get… We all know tennis is a competitive sport. Winning one slam is hard so much so that it is probably enough. In the chart below, you might recognize a few of those small bars in the far right - Roger Federer with 19 grand slam titles, Rafa with 16 and so on. But try to recollect five people who constitute the single big bar on the left hand side - people who have won just one slam!</description>
