      <description>Introduction Tackling Complexity A toy example without classes Iteration 1 Iteration 2  The same example but let‚Äôs be classy Iteration 1 Iteration 2  Conclusion   Introduction Welcome to the first post in the leveling up in Python series! In this article, I want to talk about how classes are useful to me. I am by no means an expert in program design or ‚ÄúObject Oriented Programming‚Äù. As a teen (and still do sometimes) I detested terms like encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, etc because they weren‚Äôt tangible concepts.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúSeries Intro‚Äù‚Ä¶. I started getting into a python seriously about a year ago. I tried learning the language a couple of times before that - I watched a lot of introductory tutorials in the hope of getting good at it. There was one really good one - Corey Schafer‚Äôs Python tutorials on YouTube. Barring that, most of the tutorials were basic and went over the same things over and over again - variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.</description>

      <description>Introduction (A brief note about the fastai mini-series) Why deep learning Myths about deep learning Glossary   Introduction (A brief note about the fastai mini-series) I am beginning the 2018 iteration of the popular fastai course, Practical Deep Learning for Coders. Having been a passive listener to the previous iteration of the course, I know many of the key concepts in theory. However I plan to be a lot more involved with the practical aspects of the course this time.</description>

      <description>Why I am writing this. Why git? And what is github? Myths Github is just Google Drive for code You need to be able to code to use these things  Advantages Project snapshots Pay it forward Project management A project page or wiki. Collaboration A portfolio of your research Branching, merging and pull requests Command line? No problem!  Some guidelines   Why I am writing this. Having been in the masters program in industrial engineering and computer science while doing research, I have witnessed a great deal of disconnect between the tools computer scientists use and how researchers in others fields operate.</description>

      <description>Setting Up Motivation Workflow General Instructions 1. Aggregate the data 2. Cluster the data 3. Extract the patterns 4. Formatted output  Using tidyverse to fully exploit approxmapR   ApproxmapR is an R package for the approxmap algorithm, used for exploratory data analysis of sequential data. When we have longitudinal data and we want to find out the underlying patterns, we use approxmap. approxmapR aims to provide a consistent and tidy api for using the algorithm in R.</description>

      <description>Thoughts on R and Machine Learning‚Ä¶ I started coding in R in 2015. I was pretty new to coding and especially, data science. I had heard of packages like ggplot2 and dplyr but I assumed they were packages that you learned once you learned the basics of R. ggplot2 seemed tough with words like geoms and aes and dplyr with the dangerous looking %&amp;gt;%. For a year and half, I never made an effort to learn new tools no matter how much I strugglled with base R (and to be honest, never really learnt that properly either).</description>

      <description>Why the big 4 deserve all the praise they get‚Ä¶ We all know tennis is a competitive sport. Winning one slam is hard so much so that it is probably enough. In the chart below, you might recognize a few of those small bars in the far right - Roger Federer with 19 grand slam titles, Rafa with 16 and so on. But try to recollect five people who constitute the single big bar on the left hand side - people who have won just one slam!</description>
