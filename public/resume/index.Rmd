### Projects

**Sequential Analysis of Suicide Data**   
*Fall 2017 - Current*   
- Working in an international collaboration between Texas A&amp;M, Duke University, Swansea University (UK), Edinburgh
Napier University (Scotland) and US Dept of Veteran Affairs to identify treatment patterns in suicidal PTSD patients       
- Created an R package to deploy the sequential data mining algorithm called “ApproxMap” as part of Phase I      
- Phase II will involve analyzing a huge dataset of suicidal patient treatments to identify efficient treatment patterns
and flag ineffective ones   

**Privacy Preserving Interactive Record Linkage**      
*Spring 2017*      
- Worked in a research team to create a manual framework that facilitates accurate linkage of two databases without
compromising on privacy using principles of data masking and required disclosure      
- Co-authored a paper called “Balancing Privacy and Information Disclosure in Interactive Record Linkage with Visual
Masking” which has been nominated for Best Paper Award in the CHI Conference 2018, Montreal

**Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Record Linkage using Error Generation**       
*Spring 2018*      
- Creating an error generator package in R to artificially induce a wide range of record linkage based errors in a dataset
and a framework to effortlessly compare and study different algorithms’ effectiveness in different scenarios      
- Would be an easily extensible tool for selecting the best algorithm for performing linkage for the dataset at hand

**Identifying Manufacturing Process Shifts for Quality Control**       
*Fall 2016*      
- Identified the normal and assignable causes for variations in a manufacturing process and constructed multivariate
control charts using Hoteling T2 statistic and PCA, iteratively to monitor and identify the out-of-control parameters.

**Survival Analysis of Cardiology Patients**       
*Spring 2016*      
- Implemented a random survival forest on artificially balanced data and improved the sensitivity of the model by 35%
and extracted the 20 most important blood based features that help predict mortality      
- Cox proportional hazards model on balanced data predicted the time to event 58% better than the extant models
